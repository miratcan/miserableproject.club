      "idea": "High‑signal Turkish content often gets buried in noisy feeds. The goal was to publish a weekly selection of the best articles, projects, and ideas — with editorial notes and context — in a durable, searchable archive.\n\nInstead of a raw ‘link dump’, each issue aimed to lower discovery cost with concise summaries, opinionated categories, and reliable taste.",
      "tech": "Django + HTMX for a lightweight editorial workflow and reading experience. Markdown input with Bleach‑sanitized HTML. SQLite/PostgreSQL. RSS generation and auto social posts with simple scheduled tasks (cron/Celery beat). Tailwind for templates. Newsletter via Mailgun; edge caching with Cloudflare.\n\nStarted as static export (Jamstack‑style), later moved to dynamic rendering to speed up editorial iteration.",
      "failure": "- Distribution: Organic growth plateaued around 5–7k across email and RSS; social reach was inconsistent.\n- Revenue: Sponsorship sales stayed founder‑led; fill rate hovered around 30–40%.\n- Operations: Maintaining weekly quality required 8–12 hours of editorial work; unsustainable for a solo effort.\n- SEO: Archive/taxonomy shipped late, missing long‑tail search potential.\n\nOutcome: Couldn’t reach economic sustainability without diluting quality, so the cadence was reduced.",
      "lessons": "- Distribution strategy > content format; design growth early.\n- Productize the sponsorship pipeline or it remains founder‑dependent.\n- Taxonomy and archive architecture should be first‑class from day one.\n- ‘Weekly’ is an operations problem more than a technical one; a tiny editorial stack (writer, editor, visuals) is vital.\n- Early automation (source discovery, image prep, social share) compounds.",
      "wins": "- Became a trusted reference archive for a niche Turkish readership.\n- Drove personal brand, speaking/consulting opportunities, and job leads.\n- Small open‑source tools (RSS aggregator, summarizer scripts) saw reuse.\n- Sharpened editorial packaging, headline writing, and contextualization skills.",
