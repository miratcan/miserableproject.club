      "failure": "- Distribution: Developers liked the idea but the audience was too small to sustain growth.\n- Product gap: People wanted mobile capture and cross‑platform search. Building sync and conflict resolution ballooned scope.\n- Competition: Obsidian/Notion were “good enough” with hotkeys and plugins.\n\nRevenue never covered the time to build sync safely.",
      "lessons": "- Start with the distribution channel, not features.\n- If sync is on the horizon, either commit fully or avoid it entirely.\n- A delightful CLI is not enough if the user’s capture surface is multi‑device.",
