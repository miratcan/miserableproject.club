  <blockquote>
    <p>miserableprojects.directory is a space where solopreneurs and tiny teams (no more than 3 people) share their failed side projects. No investor pitches, no success stories — just real attempts, burned weekends, wasted domains, and a few hard-earned lessons.</p>
    <p>We're building a clean, honest archive that anyone can read, but only logged-in users can contribute to. You can post anonymously. No comments. No likes. Just people who've actually tried — and failed — showing up to share what they learned. If you've crashed a few projects too, you're in the right place.</p>
