<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Miserable Projects Directory</strong> is a space where solopreneurs and tiny teams (no more than 3 people) share their failed side projects. No investor decks, no polished success stories -- just real attempts, burned weekends, wasted domains, and a few hard-earned lessons.</p>
  <p>We are building a clean, honest archive that anyone can read, but only logged-in users can contribute. You can post anonymously. No comments. No likes. Just people who have actually tried -- and failed -- showing up to share what they learned.</p>
  <p>This site may look unfinished -- that is intentional. We want it to grow together with its community. If you would like to suggest features, report issues, or even build something new, visit our <a href="https://github.com/miratcan/miserableprojects.directory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub page</a> and open an issue.</p>
  <p><strong>If you have crashed a few projects yourself, you are in the right place to cry together.</strong></p>
